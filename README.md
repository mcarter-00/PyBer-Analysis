Given that there is a greater usage of PyBer in urban cities, the total fares is consequently also higher than suburban and rural cities. PyBer transactions in urban cities totaled nearly $40,000 whereas transactions in urban cities and rural cities totaled at least $19,000 and $4,000 respectively.
